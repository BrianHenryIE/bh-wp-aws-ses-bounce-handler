# AWS SES Bounce Handler

A WordPress plugin to unsubscribe users from email lists when AWS SES sends a bounce or complaint report.

## Overview

This plugin is for WordPress sites which are configured to send email using Amazon SES.

[What Is Amazon SES?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/Welcome.html)

> Amazon SES is an email platform that provides an easy, cost-effective way for you to send and receive email using your own email addresses and domains. 

[Amazon SES and Deliverability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/sending-concepts-deliverability.html)

> If your recipient's receiver (for example, an ISP) fails to deliver your message to the recipient, the receiver bounces the message back to Amazon SES. 
>
> ...
>
> Most email client programs provide a button labeled "Mark as Spam," or similar, which moves the message to a spam folder, and forwards it to the ISP. ... If the ISP concludes that you are a spammer, and Amazon SES has a feedback loop set up with the ISP, then the ISP will send the complaint back to Amazon SES.

[Monitoring Using Amazon SES Notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/monitor-sending-using-notifications.html)

> In order to send email using Amazon SES, you must have a system in place for managing bounces and complaints.

This plugin parses the bounce and complaint notifications, adds the "Bounced Email" role to user accounts, adds a notice to WooCommerce orders, and removes the email address from [the Newsletter plugin's](https://wordpress.org/plugins/newsletter/) lists. It also fires actions (`handle_ses_bounce`, `handle_ses_complaint`) for other plugins to consume.

## Installation

Bounced emails get deleted from lists and complaints get unsubscribed.
